# JS-CC-13 : React Array Iterations

Purpose of the this coding challenge is to practice React array iterations that have object as a content

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the this coding challenge, students will be able to;

- Analyze a problem, identify and apply programming knowledge for appropriate solution.

- Demonstrate their knowledge of algorithmic design principles by using JavaScript effectively.

## Problem Statement

Create a React App

Use the [products.js](products.js) file as a source of data. And provide solutions to following tasks.

1. list all the products in smartphones category, wrap each product in a p tag, and display them in a component
